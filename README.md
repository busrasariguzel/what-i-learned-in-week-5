# `WHAT I LEARNED IN WEEK 5`

## `HRM`
I enjoyed HRM this week more than I did last week. It was a bit easier but still difficult. I think I am getting used to the logic behind it. Looking forward to learn more from HRM.

## `DOM MANIPULATION (Document Object Model)`
* Manipulating what the user see without changing HTML. 
* `` <script src="./main.js"></script>`` before ``</body> `` tag.
* Some useful things we learned:

    * `document.querySelector()` selects the element
    * `document.createDocument`
    creates the element
    * `.innerText`
    gives element a text
    * `.style.background`
    changes the background
    * `.style.fontFamily`
    changes the font type
    * `parent.appendChild(childElement)`

* never use .innerHTML because it's not secure. Use .innerText instead.

## `CSS DINER`
* `A*` Selects all elements inside of A.
* `A  + B` Selects all B elements that directly follow A.
* `A ~ B` Selects all B that follow A.
* `A > B` Selects all B that are direct children of A.
* `:first-child` Selects all first child elements
* `p :first-child` Selects all first child with ``<p>`` element.
* `:only-child` Selects only child element.
* `:last-child` Selects the last child element.
* `nth-child(A)` Selects the Ath child.

## `Ugly Query`
This is my favorite exercise! I think I love making things ugly :) I think this exercise allowed us to directly see the changes we made. It helped me to practice dom manipulation. It also allowed us to be creative-and ugly-.

## `DOMB AND DOMBER`

I really had hard time doing this exercise. The concept was clear but doing functions with dom was difficult. I really struggled at first, but it became better as I continue doing it. Going over the exercise in class helped me a lot. I was able to understand some of the questions that were unclear to me before. I would love to going over every exercise we do!

## `Domination`

I think this project was challenging. Since it is similar to Domb and Domber,it was helpful to practice some concepts. I think it made it lot better to do an exercise in class(domb and domber) and having another similar one(domination) afterwards to practice what we learned. I learned and practice the things I learned in Domb and Domber by doing Domination so I like this exercise!
